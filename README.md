# Hello there👋 ## Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I am Daniel LAWSON, a software developer based in Paris, France. I am building web apps with .NET since 2015, after training in Microsoft technologies. Also, I am a cloud enthusiast and I like to host my apps on AWS. I am 3x AWS Certified with a fourth in mind for very soon :-)
I am a continuous learner and I love to share my learnings with the community. I am also interested in system design and architecture, and tech-related topics in general.
### Again, welcome! 👍 🤗
