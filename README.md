# Hello there👋
I am **Daniel LAWSON**, a software developer based in Paris, France. I am building web apps with **C# .NET** since 2015, after a training in Microsoft technologies. Also, I am a cloud enthusiast and I like to host my apps on **AWS**. I am 3x AWS Certified with a fourth in mind for very soon :-)
I am a continuous learner and I love to share my learnings with the community. To do so, I create content on [my blog](https://danylaws.hashnode.dev/) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/danylaws). Feel free to give a follow !
### Again, welcome! 👍 🤗
