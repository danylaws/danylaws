# Hello there👋
I am Daniel LAWSON, a Software Developer based in Paris, France. I am building web apps with .NET since 2015, after training in Microsoft technologies. Also, I am a cloud enthusiast and I like to host my apps on AWS. I am 3x AWS Certified with a fourth in mind for very soon :-)
I am a continuous learner and I love to share my learnings with the community. I create content on my blog and on Twitter. Feel free to give a follow!
### Again, welcome! 👍 🤗
